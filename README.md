# AI Finance Tracker

AI-powered personal finance tracker that connects to Plaid, stores transactions in Notion, and uses GPT to help you understand your spending through natural language queries.

## About the Project

This project is my final submission for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. The goal is to build a practical financial assistant that combines real-time data, automation, and AI to improve how users interact with their finances.  After submission, I will continue building on top of it for the AI-102 certification exam. 

### 🌟 Core Features
