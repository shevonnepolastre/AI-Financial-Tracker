# AI Finance Tracker

AI-powered personal finance tracker that connects to Plaid, stores transactions in Notion, and uses GPT to help you understand your spending through natural language queries.

## About the Project

This project is my final submission for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. The goal is to build a practical financial assistant that combines real-time data, automation, and AI to improve how users interact with their finances.  After submission, I will continue building on top of it for the AI-102 certification exam. 

### Core Features
- **Plaid Integration** – Securely connect to bank accounts and retrieve recent transactions
- **Notion Sync** – Automatically store transaction data in a structured Notion database
- **AI Insights** – Use GPT to answer questions like:
  - "How much did I spend on food last week?"
  - "What was my biggest purchase in June?"
- **Smart Categorization** – Tag transactions with AI or rules-based logic (Groceries, Bills, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Plaid API**
- **Notion API**
- **OpenAI or Azure OpenAI**
